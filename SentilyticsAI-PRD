# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**Sentilytics AI**

## Overview
Sentilytics AI is a natural language-driven analytics tool that enables users to input queries in plain English to retrieve sentiment-based insights and summaries from news articles, social media, and open data sources. The output is personalized based on user-defined or prebuilt personas (e.g., investor, activist, marketer, etc.), providing targeted sentiment analysis and intelligent summarization.

---

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, professionals across industries are overwhelmed by data streams from news media, social platforms, and open government or corporate datasets. Extracting relevant sentiment-aligned insights is time-consuming, inconsistent, and lacks personalization. There's a need for a single tool that can interpret natural queries, scan diverse sources, analyze sentiment, and present persona-tailored summaries.

---

## Goals & Objectives

- Allow users to input natural language questions (e.g., "What is the public sentiment about Tesla this week?")
- Aggregate content from multiple open data sources (news APIs, social media feeds, public datasets)
- Perform sentiment analysis using NLP and ML techniques
- Provide persona-based filtered views and summaries
- Deliver actionable, concise, and context-aware insights

---

## Features

### 1. Natural Language Query Input
- Support for plain English input
- Context recognition (entity detection, timeframe parsing, sentiment targets)

### 2. Data Aggregation
- Integrate with APIs such as:
  - NewsAPI, Google News
  - X (formerly Twitter) API, Reddit API
  - Open Data portals (data.gov, EU Open Data)
- Stream and cache content from sources
- Support custom integration hooks

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Engine
- NLP pipeline to perform:
  - Entity extraction (NER)
  - Sentiment scoring (positive, neutral, negative)
  - Emotion tagging (joy, anger, surprise, etc.)
- Real-time and historical sentiment tracking

### 4. Persona Framework
- Built-in personas (Investor, Marketer, Policy Maker, Journalist, etc.)
- Custom persona creation (tags, interests, tone preference)
- Persona-specific filtering and summary tone adaptation

### 5. Summary & Visualization
- Generate short and long-form summaries based on persona
- Visualizations: sentiment graphs, word clouds, timeline trends
- Export formats: PDF, HTML, Markdown, JSON

### 6. Feedback & Learning Loop
- User feedback collection on accuracy/relevance
- Fine-tune models based on interactions
- Optional human-in-the-loop moderation

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Data source reliability**: Use fallback APIs, cache content.
- **Model accuracy bias**: Continuous fine-tuning, diverse training data.
- **Overload of irrelevant data**: Use strong filters, keyword weighting, and persona constraints.
- **Privacy concerns**: Anonymize social data, respect data source policies.

## Open Questions

- Should sentiment summaries include citations or source-level confidence scores?
- Do we allow integration with internal data sources (Slack, CRM, etc.)?
- What are the thresholds for persona-specific sentiment shifts?
